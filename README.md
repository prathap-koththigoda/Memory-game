# Memory-game

YOU HAVE TO USE XAMPP OR SOME SERVER TO PLAY THIS GAME cause it was made with MySQL/PHP.

I used Scrum method to make this. 

There are always two cards of same kind in the puzzle. You have to correclty match them. 

Try it and find out how good your memory is. 

Js, MySQL, HTML, Java were used to make this.
